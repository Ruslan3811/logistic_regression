# multyclass_logistic_regression
Realization own model of multyclass logistic regression

Aim of task:
1) Preprocessing data
2) Vizualiztion of data
3) Creation of model

Mine rule was not to use difficult function, write it myself.

What I realized myself:
1) Function "describe"
2) Vizualization of histogram
3) Scatter plot
4) Pair plot

Initially I had 2 datasets train_dataset and test_dataset. The first was used for training, the second - for prediction.
Train_dataset has 4 classes and some features. Using Scatter Plot I need to choose 2 features for creation of model.
In this project I used 2 methods of optimization - gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent and method for prediction - onevsall.
Main goal was to get accuracy>=98%.
